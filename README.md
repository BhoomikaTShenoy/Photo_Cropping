# Photo Cropping Project

## Overview
This project detects faces within an image, crops them, and saves the cropped faces with a transparent background. The goal is to ensure the inclusion of the entire face up to the shoulders.

## Features
Face Detection using OpenCV's Haar Cascade model.
Cropped Output with transparent background using PIL (Pillow) library.
Simple and easy to use script for automatic face cropping.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.x
OpenCV (cv2) library
PIL (Pillow) library

## Installation
Install the required libraries:

Copy code
pip install opencv-python pillow
Place your input image (pic.jpg) in the specified path.

## Usage
Run the script with the input image path and output directory.
The script detects faces, crops them, and saves the output with a transparent background.
